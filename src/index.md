<h2>AN INVESTIGATIVE PODCAST
FROM PUBLIC HEALTH WATCH</h2>

Fumed is about the people who live in the shadows of America’s chemical plants and oil refineries.

This season, two stubborn Texans try to salvage what’s left of their working-class community. That’s a problem, though, because they live in East Harris County, where the petrochemical industry calls the shots — and where pushing back can be dangerous. 

## CHANNELVIEW, TX
<h3> <img class="h3-glyph" src="/assets/template-imgs/map_pin_tan.svg" /> 15 MINUTES EAST OF HOUSTON</h3>

Set in Channelview, Texas, in the heart of the nation's petrochemical industry, Fumed follows Carolyn Stone and Greg Moss as they risk everything to fight for their community’s future.
