In two instances, benzene fumes were so strong that scientists with the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, or TCEQ, experienced headaches and had to leave the area.</p>\n\n<p>The scientists visited Channelview, an unincorporated community east of Houston, in 2021 and 2022, but the TCEQ didn’t finalize its reports on the findings until this year. Public Health Watch obtained them through open records requests.</p>\n\n<p>Nearly half of the one-hour averages the TCEQ’s mobile monitoring team recorded exceeded what California says is safe. Three were at least 20 times higher than California allows.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The readings also exceeded what is considered safe by the city of Houston, which created its own benzene guidelines in 2020. If the levels found in Channelview had been recorded there, residents would have received one evacuation order, eight shelter-in-place orders and eight alerts.</p>\n\n<p>Channelview residents received no notifications.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Short encounters with high levels of benzene can cause drowsiness, dizziness and unconsciousness, while chronic exposure has long been linked to leukemia and other blood cancers. Recent studies also link the chemical to diabetes and reproductive problems.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>“I definitely wouldn’t want to be the person exposed to this.&#8221;</p><cite>loren hopkins, environmental science expert and rice university professor</cite></blockquote></figure>\n\n<p>A TCEQ spokesperson said the Texas guidelines are “well below” the level where the state has determined health effects occur. Those guidelines are based on a handful of scientific studies from the 1980s and 1990s. The more stringent Houston guidelines are based on a <a href=\"https://setac.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ieam.4814\">peer-reviewed paper</a> that evaluated 20 studies published between 2009 and 2019.</p>\n\n<p>The TCEQ spokesperson said the agency has reviewed the science supporting benzene guidelines used by other institutions, but none of it has “warranted a reevaluation of TCEQ’s” guidelines.</p>\n\n<p>“Just because a scientific study is more recent does not make it the best scientific evidence,” the spokesperson said.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"877\" src=\"https://publichealthwatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Hourly-samples-graphic-1024x877.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-14952\" srcset=\"https://publichealthwatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Hourly-samples-graphic-1024x877.png 1024w, https://publichealthwatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Hourly-samples-graphic-300x257.png 300w, https://publichealthwatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Hourly-samples-graphic-768x658.png 768w, https://publichealthwatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Hourly-samples-graphic-1200x1027.png 1200w, https://publichealthwatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Hourly-samples-graphic-400x342.png 400w, https://publichealthwatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Hourly-samples-graphic-706x604.png 706w, https://publichealthwatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Hourly-samples-graphic.png 1272w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n<p>The spikes the TCEQ monitoring team found in 2021 and 2022 are especially alarming because they weren’t recorded by the state’s closest stationary monitor, whose annual readings are used to gauge residents’ cancer risk. Public Health Watch discovered the discrepancy when it compared hourly readings collected by the field scientists with hourly readings from the stationary monitor.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Loren Hopkins, a nationally recognized expert in environmental science and a professor at Rice University, used data from the stationary monitor to calculate the total lifetime cancer risk from chemical exposure for residents of south Channelview. She said they face a risk as high as 78 cases in 1 million people — more than double the state and national average of 30 in 1 million.</p>\n\n<p>The risk would be much higher, Hopkins said, if the monitor isn’t capturing benzene emissions from Channelview’s southeastern corner, as Public Health Watch’s analysis suggests.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Hopkins, who co-authored the paper that helped shape Houston’s guidelines, said Channelview’s benzene levels are “unacceptably high.”</p>\n\n<p>“I definitely wouldn’t want to be the person exposed to this,” she said.</p>\n\n<p>Yvette Arellano, founder of the Houston-based environmental justice group Fenceline Watch, wasn’t surprised that Channelview residents weren’t notified about the high concentrations — or that the TCEQ’s monitor isn’t positioned to capture emissions from an area with a history of benzene pollution.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>“Folks who live in communities throughout the [Houston] Ship Channel know this isn&#8217;t new news,” said Arellano, whose group advocates for people who live near polluting industries. “Is it right? No, this is completely reprehensible. This is a lack of oversight. This is industry in the Wild West within a major city of the country.”</p>\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained\"><div class=\"wp-block-columns has-background is-layout-flex wp-container-core-columns-is-layout-1 wp-block-columns-is-layout-flex\" style=\"background-color:#a3cfee;padding-top:var(--wp--preset--spacing--30);padding-right:var(--wp--preset--spacing--30);padding-bottom:var(--wp--preset--spacing--30);padding-left:var(--wp--preset--spacing--30)\"><div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\" style=\"flex-basis:33.33%\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://publichealthwatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Fumed_Podcast_Final_3000x3000-1024x1024.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-14946\" style=\"width:235px;height:auto\" srcset=\"https://publichealthwatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Fumed_Podcast_Final_3000x3000-1024x1024.png 1024w, https://publichealthwatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Fumed_Podcast_Final_3000x3000-300x300.png?crop=1 300w, https://publichealthwatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Fumed_Podcast_Final_3000x3000-150x150.png?crop=1 150w, https://publichealthwatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Fumed_Podcast_Final_3000x3000-768x768.png 768w, https://publichealthwatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Fumed_Podcast_Final_3000x3000-1536x1536.png 1536w, https://publichealthwatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Fumed_Podcast_Final_3000x3000-2048x2048.png 2048w, https://publichealthwatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Fumed_Podcast_Final_3000x3000-1200x1200.png?crop=1 1200w, https://publichealthwatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Fumed_Podcast_Final_3000x3000-800x800.png?crop=1 800w, https://publichealthwatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Fumed_Podcast_Final_3000x3000-600x600.png?crop=1 600w, https://publichealthwatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Fumed_Podcast_Final_3000x3000-400x400.png?crop=1 400w, https://publichealthwatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Fumed_Podcast_Final_3000x3000-200x200.png?crop=1 200w, https://publichealthwatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Fumed_Podcast_Final_3000x3000-1568x1568.png 1568w, https://publichealthwatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Fumed_Podcast_Final_3000x3000-2000x2000.png 2000w, https://publichealthwatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Fumed_Podcast_Final_3000x3000-706x706.png 706w, https://publichealthwatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Fumed_Podcast_Final_3000x3000-100x100.png?crop=1 100w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure></div>\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\" style=\"flex-basis:66.66%\"><h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-center\" style=\"font-size:32px\">Coming in 2025:<br>An Investigative Podcast</h2>\n\n<p>Public Health Watch will launch a serial podcast centered on Channelview, Texas.

The barges that transport chemicals to and from the channel’s ships and chemical plants often dock in the majority-Latino community of 45,700.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The most recent tests in Channelview were conducted in June by scientists from Texas A&amp;M University, who have a monitoring van similar to the TCEQ’s. Their report hasn’t been finalized, but Natalie Johnson, a respiratory toxicologist who leads the team, said they recorded instantaneous levels of benzene similar to the spikes the TCEQ found in 2021 and 2022. An instantaneous reading lasts for one second.</p>\n\n<p>Johnson said she will share the results with the TCEQ and will hold a community meeting for residents in January.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>A TCEQ spokesperson said the agency has no plans to address Channelview’s benzene levels, because the annual averages recorded by the stationary monitor are within the state guideline.</p>\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group is-style-default has-light-gray-background-color has-background\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained\"><p class=\"has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-91640ed3879840703a1d20dc9c0c9fdf\" style=\"color:#d93107;font-size:25px\"><strong>Channelview&#8217;s Benzene Crisis at a Glance</strong> </p>\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>New data show that residents of Channelview, Texas, were exposed to higher levels of cancer-causing benzene in 2021 than ever recorded in the community’s 20-year history with the chemical.

That’s where a barge-cleaning and chemical distribution facility called K-Solv is located less than 600 feet from houses.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The agency cut back on its mobile monitoring program in the mid-2000s and partnered with Texas universities and a private company — FluxSense Inc. — to periodically monitor chemical levels in Harris County, including Channelview.</p>\n\n<p>FluxSense’s most <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25451984-fluxsense-2023-report/#document/p1\">recent report</a>, filed in 2023, doesn’t mention K-Solv by name but includes maps that label the area immediately around the facility as “Site A.” The report said that since at least 2013 FluxSense has “regularly noted” one source of “persistent and significant” emissions of benzene and several other chemicals that attack the nervous system. A TCEQ spokesperson confirmed that the source was Site A.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"572\" src=\"https://publichealthwatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Benzene-Plumes-FluxSense-report-for-TCEQ-1024x572.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-14955\" srcset=\"https://publichealthwatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Benzene-Plumes-FluxSense-report-for-TCEQ-1024x572.png 1024w, https://publichealthwatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Benzene-Plumes-FluxSense-report-for-TCEQ-300x168.png 300w, https://publichealthwatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Benzene-Plumes-FluxSense-report-for-TCEQ-768x429.png 768w, https://publichealthwatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Benzene-Plumes-FluxSense-report-for-TCEQ-400x223.png 400w, https://publichealthwatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Benzene-Plumes-FluxSense-report-for-TCEQ-706x394.png 706w, https://publichealthwatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Benzene-Plumes-FluxSense-report-for-TCEQ.png 1194w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Scientists with the consulting firm FluxSense Inc. documented a large benzene plume on September 23, 2022, from “Site A,” which is the immediate area around K-Solv.

Riddle declined to be interviewed for this story, but in an email he said his company’s benzene emissions are “tiny” compared to “the other companies and barges upwind and around us.”&nbsp;</p><p>“K-Solv is deeply committed to environmental stewardship and prioritizes the health and safety of our Channelview residential community,” Riddle said. “We’ve invested millions of dollars in advanced pollution control systems to ensure a healthy environment for our employees and neighbors.”</p><p>The TCEQ has allowed K-Solv to expand four times since the agency discovered high levels of benzene near the facility in 2005. K-Solv can now legally release almost 20 times more volatile organic compounds — which include benzene — than it did in 2005. Last year the TCEQ allowed K-Solv to open a second, smaller business in Channelview, which washes trucks that haul chemicals. It, too, releases volatile organic compounds into the air, according to its permit.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Trivializing the Threat</strong></h3><p>The TCEQ has taken two steps over the years that make Channelview’s benzene problem look better on paper.&nbsp;</p><p>It loosened its benzene guidelines, even as other states were tightening their protections. The hourly benzene guideline was weakened by 620% (from 25 parts of benzene per billion parts of air, or ppb, to 180 ppb). The annual guideline was weakened by 40% (from 1 ppb to 1.4 ppb).</p><p>The TCEQ also moved the stationary monitor farther from K-Solv, and it’s no longer downwind of the company. The agency said it chose the new location so it could install a more sophisticated monitor that was too large for the old site.</p><p>During the 18 months before the monitor was moved, it recorded rolling annual benzene averages that exceeded even the TCEQ’s weakened annual guideline by up to 50%.&nbsp;</p><p>Since the move, annual benzene emissions have never exceeded the guideline, although they are rising.&nbsp;</p><p>In June, the TCEQ released guidelines to protect its field scientists from chemical emissions. It suggests they leave an area if instantaneous benzene levels exceed 1080 ppb, as they did four times during the Channelview trips.</p><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"946\" src=\"https://publichealthwatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Annual-averages-graph-1024x946.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-14951\" srcset=\"https://publichealthwatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Annual-averages-graph-1024x946.png 1024w, https://publichealthwatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Annual-averages-graph-300x277.png 300w, https://publichealthwatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Annual-averages-graph-768x710.png 768w, https://publichealthwatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Annual-averages-graph-1200x1109.png 1200w, https://publichealthwatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Annual-averages-graph-400x370.png 400w, https://publichealthwatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Annual-averages-graph-706x652.png 706w, https://publichealthwatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Annual-averages-graph.png 1240w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure><h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>TCEQ Returns to Channelview</strong></h3><p>Unlike earlier TCEQ monitoring reports from Channelview, the reports from the 2021 and 2022 trips don’t name K-Solv, or any other facility, as a source of pollution.&nbsp;</p><p>Tim Doty, who managed the TCEQ mobile monitoring team for 17 years, reviewed wind directions and sample locations included in documents filed with the reports. He said the data show that the scientists looked for benzene sources throughout south Channelview, including barges moored along the San Jacinto River and facilities south of Channelview’s homes. But, Doty said, they were clearly focused on emissions from K-Solv and from barges waiting to be cleaned at the company’s dock.</p><p>“There’s no doubt from looking at the data that the primary source of the elevated benzene concentrations was from around K-Solv,” Doty said. “It’s right there.”</p><p>A TCEQ spokesperson said the agency doesn’t identify sources of pollution until investigators follow up on the monitoring team’s findings.

<p>Data collected during the state’s most recent air monitoring trips include one benzene reading that was three times the Texas hourly guideline, the weakest in the nation. In two instances, benzene fumes were so strong that scientists with the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, or TCEQ, experienced headaches and had to leave the area.</p>

<p>The scientists visited Channelview, an unincorporated community east of Houston, in 2021 and 2022, but the TCEQ didn’t finalize its reports on the findings until this year. Public Health Watch obtained them through open records requests.</p>

<p>Nearly half of the one-hour averages the TCEQ’s mobile monitoring team recorded exceeded what California says is safe. Three were at least 20 times higher than California allows.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The readings also exceeded what is considered safe by the city of Houston, which created its own benzene guidelines in 2020. If the levels found in Channelview had been recorded there, residents would have received one evacuation order, eight shelter-in-place orders and eight alerts.</p>

<p>Channelview residents received no notifications.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Short encounters with high levels of benzene can cause drowsiness, dizziness and unconsciousness, while chronic exposure has long been linked to leukemia and other blood cancers. Recent studies also link the chemical to diabetes and reproductive problems.&nbsp;</p>

<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>“I definitely wouldn’t want to be the person exposed to this.&#8221;</p><cite>loren hopkins, environmental science expert and rice university professor</cite></blockquote></figure>

<p>A TCEQ spokesperson said the Texas guidelines are “well below” the level where the state has determined health effects occur. Those guidelines are based on a handful of scientific studies from the 1980s and 1990s. The more stringent Houston guidelines are based on a <a href="https://setac.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ieam.4814">peer-reviewed paper</a> that evaluated 20 studies published between 2009 and 2019.</p>

<p>The TCEQ spokesperson said the agency has reviewed the science supporting benzene guidelines used by other institutions, but none of it has “warranted a reevaluation of TCEQ’s” guidelines.</p>

<p>“Just because a scientific study is more recent does not make it the best scientific evidence,” the spokesperson said.</p>

<p>The spikes the TCEQ monitoring team found in 2021 and 2022 are especially alarming because they weren’t recorded by the state’s closest stationary monitor, whose annual readings are used to gauge residents’ cancer risk. Public Health Watch discovered the discrepancy when it compared hourly readings collected by the field scientists with hourly readings from the stationary monitor.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Loren Hopkins, a nationally recognized expert in environmental science and a professor at Rice University, used data from the stationary monitor to calculate the total lifetime cancer risk from chemical exposure for residents of south Channelview. She said they face a risk as high as 78 cases in 1 million people — more than double the state and national average of 30 in 1 million.</p>

<p>The risk would be much higher, Hopkins said, if the monitor isn’t capturing benzene emissions from Channelview’s southeastern corner, as Public Health Watch’s analysis suggests.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hopkins, who co-authored the paper that helped shape Houston’s guidelines, said Channelview’s benzene levels are “unacceptably high.”</p>

<p>“I definitely wouldn’t want to be the person exposed to this,” she said.</p>

<p>Yvette Arellano, founder of the Houston-based environmental justice group Fenceline Watch, wasn’t surprised that Channelview residents weren’t notified about the high concentrations — or that the TCEQ’s monitor isn’t positioned to capture emissions from an area with a history of benzene pollution.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>“Folks who live in communities throughout the [Houston] Ship Channel know this isn&#8217;t new news,” said Arellano, whose group advocates for people who live near polluting industries. “Is it right? No, this is completely reprehensible. This is a lack of oversight. This is industry in the Wild West within a major city of the country.”</p>

<p>Channelview is a few miles upriver from the Houston Ship Channel, a 52-mile long waterway lined by hundreds of industrial facilities. The barges that transport chemicals to and from the channel’s ships and chemical plants often dock in the majority-Latino community of 45,700.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The most recent tests in Channelview were conducted in June by scientists from Texas A&amp;M University, who have a monitoring van similar to the TCEQ’s. Their report hasn’t been finalized, but Natalie Johnson, a respiratory toxicologist who leads the team, said they recorded instantaneous levels of benzene similar to the spikes the TCEQ found in 2021 and 2022. An instantaneous reading lasts for one second.</p>

<p>Johnson said she will share the results with the TCEQ and will hold a community meeting for residents in January.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>A TCEQ spokesperson said the agency has no plans to address Channelview’s benzene levels, because the annual averages recorded by the stationary monitor are within the state guideline.</p>

<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>New data show that residents of Channelview, Texas, were exposed to higher levels of cancer-causing benzene in 2021 than ever recorded in the community’s 20-year history with the chemical. State regulators never told residents.&nbsp;</li></ul>

<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>If Channelview’s benzene levels had been recorded in nearby Houston, residents would have received one evacuation order, eight shelter-in-place orders and eight alerts.&nbsp;</li></ul></div></div>

<p>“These concentrations of benzene do not represent a risk to human health or the environment, and no further action is needed,” the spokesperson said.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>‘Persistent and Significant’ Emissions&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>A Public Health Watch investigation published last year found that Texas regulators have known since at least 2005 that Channelview residents are being exposed to high levels of benzene — and that the TCEQ monitoring team has often recorded the highest benzene emissions in the southeastern corner of the community. That’s where a barge-cleaning and chemical distribution facility called K-Solv is located less than 600 feet from houses.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The agency cut back on its mobile monitoring program in the mid-2000s and partnered with Texas universities and a private company — FluxSense Inc. — to periodically monitor chemical levels in Harris County, including Channelview.</p>

<p>FluxSense’s most <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25451984-fluxsense-2023-report/#document/p1">recent report</a>, filed in 2023, doesn’t mention K-Solv by name but includes maps that label the area immediately around the facility as “Site A.” The report said that since at least 2013 FluxSense has “regularly noted” one source of “persistent and significant” emissions of benzene and several other chemicals that attack the nervous system. A TCEQ spokesperson confirmed that the source was Site A.</p>

<p>When a fire broke out among K-Solv’s chemical tanks in 2021, the TCEQ’s then director of monitoring said in an email to his staff that the facility was “known for benzene emissions.”</p></div></div><p>K-Solv CEO Todd Riddle has consistently denied that the company is a major source of&nbsp; benzene emissions. Riddle declined to be interviewed for this story, but in an email he said his company’s benzene emissions are “tiny” compared to “the other companies and barges upwind and around us.”&nbsp;</p><p>“K-Solv is deeply committed to environmental stewardship and prioritizes the health and safety of our Channelview residential community,” Riddle said. “We’ve invested millions of dollars in advanced pollution control systems to ensure a healthy environment for our employees and neighbors.”</p><p>The TCEQ has allowed K-Solv to expand four times since the agency discovered high levels of benzene near the facility in 2005. K-Solv can now legally release almost 20 times more volatile organic compounds — which include benzene — than it did in 2005. Last year the TCEQ allowed K-Solv to open a second, smaller business in Channelview, which washes trucks that haul chemicals. It, too, releases volatile organic compounds into the air, according to its permit.&nbsp;</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Trivializing the Threat</strong></h3><p>The TCEQ has taken two steps over the years that make Channelview’s benzene problem look better on paper.&nbsp;</p><p>It loosened its benzene guidelines, even as other states were tightening their protections. The hourly benzene guideline was weakened by 620% (from 25 parts of benzene per billion parts of air, or ppb, to 180 ppb). The annual guideline was weakened by 40% (from 1 ppb to 1.4 ppb).</p><p>The TCEQ also moved the stationary monitor farther from K-Solv, and it’s no longer downwind of the company. The agency said it chose the new location so it could install a more sophisticated monitor that was too large for the old site.</p><p>During the 18 months before the monitor was moved, it recorded rolling annual benzene averages that exceeded even the TCEQ’s weakened annual guideline by up to 50%.&nbsp;</p><p>Since the move, annual benzene emissions have never exceeded the guideline, although they are rising.&nbsp;</p><p>In June, the TCEQ released guidelines to protect its field scientists from chemical emissions. It suggests they leave an area if instantaneous benzene levels exceed 1080 ppb, as they did four times during the Channelview trips.</p><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="946" src="https://publichealthwatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Annual-averages-graph-1024x946.png" alt="" class="wp-image-14951" srcset="https://publichealthwatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Annual-averages-graph-1024x946.png 1024w, https://publichealthwatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Annual-averages-graph-300x277.png 300w, https://publichealthwatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Annual-averages-graph-768x710.png 768w, https://publichealthwatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Annual-averages-graph-1200x1109.png 1200w, https://publichealthwatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Annual-averages-graph-400x370.png 400w, https://publichealthwatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Annual-averages-graph-706x652.png 706w, https://publichealthwatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Annual-averages-graph.png 1240w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure><h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>TCEQ Returns to Channelview</strong></h3><p>Unlike earlier TCEQ monitoring reports from Channelview, the reports from the 2021 and 2022 trips don’t name K-Solv, or any other facility, as a source of pollution.&nbsp;</p><p>Tim Doty, who managed the TCEQ mobile monitoring team for 17 years, reviewed wind directions and sample locations included in documents filed with the reports. He said the data show that the scientists looked for benzene sources throughout south Channelview, including barges moored along the San Jacinto River and facilities south of Channelview’s homes. But, Doty said, they were clearly focused on emissions from K-Solv and from barges waiting to be cleaned at the company’s dock.</p><p>“There’s no doubt from looking at the data that the primary source of the elevated benzene concentrations was from around K-Solv,” Doty said. “It’s right there.”</p><p>A TCEQ spokesperson said the agency doesn’t identify sources of pollution until investigators follow up on the monitoring team’s findings.

According to Doty’s review of the TCEQ data, the sample was primarily downwind of K-Solv, about 500 feet west of the facility. The scientists smelled strong gasoline odors and suffered headaches and lightheadedness, according to <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25451987-tceq-november-2021-toxicological-evaluation/#document/p1">a report by TCEQ toxicologists</a>.

<p>On November 8, 2021, TCEQ field scientists recorded two one-hour benzene averages that exceeded the state’s guideline. But neither showed up on the TCEQ’s stationary monitor, whose readings are used to gauge residents’ cancer risk. When the scientists measured a one-hour average of 203.5 parts of benzene per billion parts of air (ppb), the monitor recorded only 1.2 ppb. When the scientists recorded an hourly average of 534.6 ppb, the monitor’s highest average was just 7.8 ppb.</p>

After K-Solv missed that deadline, the agency sent the case to its litigation division.&nbsp;</p><p>Riddle blamed one of the violations on a clerical error that led the company to mistakenly record that it had stored benzene at 100% concentration.
